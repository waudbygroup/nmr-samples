        <h1>Getting Started</h1>

        <p>The NMR Sample Manager runs in your browser. All data stays on your computer —
            there is no server and nothing is uploaded. You need <strong>Chrome, Chromium, or
                Edge</strong> (the app uses the File System Access API, which other browsers don't
            support).</p>

        <h2>Online Access</h2>

        <p>Open <a href="index.html">the application</a> and grant file system permissions
            when prompted. That's it.</p>

        <h2>Offline Access</h2>

        <p>Download <a href="download/nmr-samples.zip">nmr-samples.zip</a>, extract it,
            and open <code>index.html</code> in Chrome or Edge. The app works identically
            to the online version.</p>

        <h2>Setting Up Directories</h2>

        <p>Click <strong>Set</strong> next to "Root:" and select your main NMR data folder
            (e.g. <code>/data/nmr</code> or <code>C:\Bruker\TopSpin4\data</code>). Then click
            <strong>Browse</strong> to navigate to a specific experiment folder. The app scans
            the folder for existing sample metadata and experiment directories.
        </p>

        <h2>Creating a Sample</h2>

        <p>Click <strong>New Sample</strong> to open the annotation form. All fields are
            optional — fill in what matters for your work. You can record information about
            users, sample components (name, concentration, isotopic labelling), buffer
            conditions (pH, components, solvent), NMR tube details, and laboratory references.
            Click <strong>Save</strong> or press Enter to store the metadata as a JSON file in
            the experiment directory.</p>

        <h2>Editing and Duplicating</h2>

        <p>Select a sample and click <strong>Edit</strong> to modify it. Click
            <strong>Duplicate</strong> to copy it as a template for a related sample — useful
            for titration series or other experiments where only a few parameters change.
        </p>

        <h2>Ejecting Samples</h2>

        <p>Click <strong>Eject</strong> to timestamp when a sample was removed from the
            spectrometer. This marks the end of the sample's active period and helps track
            what's currently loaded.</p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>

        <p>Click <strong>Show timeline</strong> to see the chronological history of all
            samples in the current experiment folder, including when they were created,
            modified, and ejected.</p>

        <h2>File Storage</h2>

        <p>Sample metadata is stored as human-readable JSON files alongside your experiment
            data, with filenames like <code>2025-10-23_143022_lysozyme.json</code>. These
            files can be opened in any text editor and work well with version control. They
            follow a shared <a href="https://github.com/nmr-samples/schema">open schema</a>,
            so they're compatible with the
            <a href="https://nmr-samples.github.io/topspin/">TopSpin integration</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/waudbygroup/NMRTools.jl">NMRTools.jl</a>, and other
            tools in the ecosystem.
